## Exploring Influencers’ Remark Effects on the US Financial Market

This project explores whether influencers’ remarks affect the financial market.  With an estimated 70 billion dollars of investment lost in the Reddit WallStreetBets and GameStop incident, non-fundamental factors have gained more attention. Hedge fund managers, financial investment professionals, retail investors, and mutual fund managers, are among those who may seek these potentials to outperform the market an/or reduce investment risks.

Selected influencers’ remarks include Trump’s tweets, WallStreetBets Reddit, and Jerome Powell’s speeches.

Economic and financial keywords are extracted from their messages and counted by their posting dates from January 1, 2016, to April 2021. Market movements in relation to the keyword frequencies, sentiments, and changes in economic indicators on news release dates are explored. Interpretability and predictability of these relations are elucidated using machine learning methods.

Results indicate that the financial market maintains its efficiency. The methods may be modified for exploring non-fundamental effects on returns on investment portfolios to add weight of these effects to their fundamental investment metrics.
